MAKE TESTS FOR ALL THINGS LIKE: There is a Publish/Fetch configuration but data is missing in the db.

GENERAL:
1) Enter Update or Refresh when there is nothing to be Updated or Refreshed
2) None of the functionalities should be available unless the user is logged in


PROD:
- the application doesn't display anything if there is no items in the datastore[1]

What is going to happen when trying to 'Update' or 'Refresh' when there is no items in the datastore[1]
Allow deletion of items on Blueberry[1]
Handle situation when a sheet in a workbook was deleted and 'Refresh' has no destination place[1]
Record demo and put it on the landing page[1]
set maxJsonLength or at least do Exception Handling[1]
Handling corner situation[no items, one item, massive number of items]

Sort all data according to Last Updated[1]
Create an installer[1]
Pay extra attention to 'Update' maximum length. Sometimes it tries to get over 1mln rows[1]
Perform tests on real files and data[1]
Set up testing framework[1]
Write unit tests to existing code[1]
Create accounts in Prod for BP, MW, OL, Wacek, Ernst Berger[1]

Handle RequestTooLargeError on GAE[1] - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6898736/upload-file-bigger-than-40mb-to-google-app-engine
Ribbon1.cs -> Should Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes - should it rather encode to UTF, to ensure correct processing to foreign email addresses and passwords[2]
Register - already used email notification[2]
The prototype queries all BAPI datatypes when /display - maybe it makes sense to optimize this[2]
After register - move to /display[2]
Implement active nav-bar script[2]
Make the password ****** in Excel Add-in[2]
If user is not logged-in -> implement redirection to the requested page after login[2]

Clean up the code from old comments[2]
Create example of a microservice[2]
Possibly abstract the HTTP request in C#[2]
Implement the most efficient way of saving data to excel[2]
Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - pass variables defined inside the method as as arguments.[2]
Refactor FetchingHelpers.saveToExcel() - switch cases may not be nessary(just enter the type parameter as 
an argument to saveArrayToExcel() method.[2]
Create samples for all URLs in case users have no access yet[2]

Implement full permissions functionality[3]
fromExcelToObject - see if it's possible to store all data as list of lists[3]

Do we need confirmation every single time a data is updated or only for several items?[3]
Think how often should I refactor[3]
Implement releaseObject garbage collector[3]

Error messages should be more 'juicy'. Currently all of them look exactly the same.[3]
Make the timing filter more adjusted to the locale of each computer[3]

Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - most likely use some version of eval()[3]

LONG-TERM:
Analyze all possible variants of reading code for publishing

ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE BY END OF JUNE. AT THE BEGINING OF JULY YOU SHOULD ALREADY START TESTING WITH DEPLOYED SOLUTION - USERS.

DONE:
When trying to download a wrong BAPIID - "Please connect to Internet"[1]
Check all data types are represented as actual data types in tests.[1]
Blueberry ID should be more visible than other data - red color[1]
Have one confirmation for 'Update' only.[1]

Disallow to create a Publish Task Pane twice.[1]
Make changes to the information display according to the user email address[1]
Remove the user from BlueberryTaskPane - get the user from GlobalVariables - LoggedInUser[1]
When publishing it asks to connect to Internet, even though the connection exists[1]
Try to input incorrect Blueberry ID[1]
Empty BlueberryID validation[1]
Write error hanlder for 500[1]

When some of the items 'Publish' task pane are not filled up, its still possible to make a request[1]
Remove 'needs to contain a digit" in 'Publish taskpane'[1]
Sometimes when trying to log-in the system hangs with Stream postStream = request.GetRequestStream() - WebException problem[1]
Notification that the user should be logged in before sending publish/download/etc in Excel add-in[1]
Deploy to production[1]

Display dates correctly -2H
Currently the /Display only shows lists -> it should show all data types[1]
Change the name of the platform to RC Bay[1]
Implement a button to open the Blueberry Platform
Rethink the Publish concept - Update one data structure only/update all data structures in the workbook[1]
Think about xlID in 'Publishing' the same formatting as for xlName be aplied for xlOrganization?[1]
Think about all possible scenarios when think can go wrong and test them[1]
A very long string is entered in 'Description'
One of the items in 'Publish' task pane is not entered
When the list is imported it is pasted in a format [1,33,5,44,3]
When you click 'Publish' on BlueberryTaskPane, the same operations are performed twice[1]
