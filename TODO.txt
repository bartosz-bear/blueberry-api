MAKE TESTS FOR ALL THINGS LIKE: There is a Publish/Fetch configuration but data is missing in the db.

Implement real life examples[1]
Allow deletion of items on Blueberry[1]
There is a problem when there are two Blueberry Task Panes open. Data is sent only from one[1]
Record demo and put it on the landing page[1]
Implement favourites in Bluebbery tab - eg. Budget rates, FX Rates[1]
Other people TOP 10 used[1]
"Taskpane has been deleted or is otherwise no longer valid."[1]
Sometimes lists say that they are uploade but nothing is uploaded on the server side - current_item = request_data[r][c][1]
Make all data items a list of lists[1]

Sort all data according to Last Updated[1]
Create an installer[1]
Set up testing framework[1]
Write unit tests to existing code[1]
Create accounts in Prod for BP, MW, OL, Wacek, Ernst Berger[1]

Implement counter: how many times a certain data was requested[2]
Show other people who are using this data feed[2]
Show all BAPI IDs used in the current workbook[2]
Implement sign certificate - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb772086.aspx#signing [2]
Provide notification for 'Refresh' if there is nothing to be refreshed[2]
Check if everything works fine also in xls type of file[2]
When updating Table(and most likely the same problem exists for Dict) if there is no data in the first column, then it would return 'No data in the range'[2]
Update seetings[we need a seperate settings mode to set up: refresh on item level, sheet, workbook, workbooks.
Also needs settings to define whether update should for the same range or extension][2]
Handle RequestTooLargeError on GAE[2] - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6898736/upload-file-bigger-than-40mb-to-google-app-engine
Ribbon1.cs -> Should Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes - should it rather encode to UTF, to ensure correct processing to foreign email addresses and passwords[2]
Register - already used email notification[2]
The prototype queries all BAPI datatypes when /display - maybe it makes sense to optimize this[2]
After register - move to /display[2]
Implement active nav-bar script[2]
Make the password ****** in Excel Add-in[2]
If user is not logged-in -> implement redirection to the requested page after login[2]
Document Python code[2]
saveToExcel() function has to be reorganized. saveArrayToExcel()[2]
Implement threading/parallism for requests in order to prevent 'a hanging application'[2]
Fix visible exception pop-up when pressing Publish[2]
Clean up the code from old comments[2]
Create example of a microservice[2]
Possibly abstract the HTTP request in C#[2]
Implement the most efficient way of saving data to excel[2]
Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - pass variables defined inside the method as as arguments.[2]
Refactor FetchingHelpers.saveToExcel() - switch cases may not be nessary(just enter the type parameter as 
an argument to saveArrayToExcel() method.[2]
Create samples for all URLs in case users have no access yet[2]

Change the max value of maxJSONLength to 2 147 483 647 [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1151987/can-i-set-an-unlimited-length-for-maxjsonlength-in-web-config/1151993#1151993][3]
Formal analysis of each important function and class[3]
When Updating or Refreshing, in case a sheet is missing, the program silently processses it but doesn't show any notification that something was missing. Maybe there should be a notification.[3]
Notifications to the subscribers that certain BlueberryID is going to be deleted[2]
Implement full permissions functionality[3]
fromExcelToObject - see if it's possible to store all data as list of lists[3]
Implement all code in the asynchronous manner[3]
Do we need confirmation every single time a data is updated or only for several items?[3]
Think how often should I refactor[3]
Implement releaseObject garbage collector[3]
Verify the access identifier for each class and method[3]
Error messages should be more 'juicy'. Currently all of them look exactly the same.[3]
Make the timing filter more adjusted to the locale of each computer[3]
Make the color grey like in /login screen[3]
Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - most likely use some version of eval()[3]

LONG-TERM:
Analyze all possible variants of reading code for publishing

ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE BY END OF JUNE. AT THE BEGINING OF JULY YOU SHOULD ALREADY START TESTING WITH DEPLOYED SOLUTION - USERS.
