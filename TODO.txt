MAKE TESTS FOR ALL THINGS LIKE: There is a Publish/Fetch configuration but data is missing in the db.

Allow deletion of items on Blueberry[1]
Handle situation when a sheet in a workbook was deleted and 'Refresh' has no destination place[1]
Record demo and put it on the landing page[1]
set maxJsonLength or at least do Exception Handling[1]
Handling corner situation[no items, one item, massive number of items]

Sort all data according to Last Updated[1]
Create an installer[1]

Perform tests on real files and data[1]
Set up testing framework[1]
Write unit tests to existing code[1]
Create accounts in Prod for BP, MW, OL, Wacek, Ernst Berger[1]

Provide notification for 'Refresh' if there is nothing to be refreshed[2]
Check if everything works fine also in xls type of file[2]
When updating Table(and most likely the same problem exists for Dict) if there is no data in the first column, then it would return 'No data in the range'[2]
Update seetings[we need a seperate settings mode to set up: refresh on item level, sheet, workbook, workbooks.
Also needs settings to define whether update should for the same range or extension][2]
Handle RequestTooLargeError on GAE[2] - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6898736/upload-file-bigger-than-40mb-to-google-app-engine
Ribbon1.cs -> Should Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes - should it rather encode to UTF, to ensure correct processing to foreign email addresses and passwords[2]
Register - already used email notification[2]
The prototype queries all BAPI datatypes when /display - maybe it makes sense to optimize this[2]
After register - move to /display[2]
Implement active nav-bar script[2]
Make the password ****** in Excel Add-in[2]
If user is not logged-in -> implement redirection to the requested page after login[2]
Document Python code[2]
saveToExcel() function has to be reorganized. saveArrayToExcel()[2]
Implement threading/parallism for requests in order to prevent 'a hanging application'[2]
Fix visible exception pop-up when pressing Publish[2]
Clean up the code from old comments[2]
Create example of a microservice[2]
Possibly abstract the HTTP request in C#[2]
Implement the most efficient way of saving data to excel[2]
Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - pass variables defined inside the method as as arguments.[2]
Refactor FetchingHelpers.saveToExcel() - switch cases may not be nessary(just enter the type parameter as 
an argument to saveArrayToExcel() method.[2]
Create samples for all URLs in case users have no access yet[2]

Notifications to the subscribers that certain BlueberryID is going to be deleted[2]
Implement full permissions functionality[3]
fromExcelToObject - see if it's possible to store all data as list of lists[3]
Implement all code in the asynchronous manner[3]
Do we need confirmation every single time a data is updated or only for several items?[3]
Think how often should I refactor[3]
Implement releaseObject garbage collector[3]
Verify the access identifier for each class and method[3]
Error messages should be more 'juicy'. Currently all of them look exactly the same.[3]
Make the timing filter more adjusted to the locale of each computer[3]
Make the color grey like in /login screen[3]
Refactor validatePublishingInputs() - most likely use some version of eval()[3]

LONG-TERM:
Analyze all possible variants of reading code for publishing

ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE BY END OF JUNE. AT THE BEGINING OF JULY YOU SHOULD ALREADY START TESTING WITH DEPLOYED SOLUTION - USERS.

DONE:
What is going to happen when trying to 'Update' or 'Refresh' when there is no items in the datastore[1]
Notification in case data which was being updated was not existing in the datastore[1]
The application doesn't display anything if there is no items in the datastore[1]
Enter Update or Refresh when there is nothing to be Updated or Refreshed
None of the functionalities should be available unless the user is logged in
When trying to download a wrong BAPIID - "Please connect to Internet"[1]
Check all data types are represented as actual data types in tests.[1]
Blueberry ID should be more visible than other data - red color[1]
Have one confirmation for 'Update' only.[1]
Close TaskPane after Publishing. First check whether a new one wouldn't be created in case the old one is hidden[1].
Disallow to create a Publish Task Pane twice.[1]
Make changes to the information display according to the user email address[1]
Remove the user from BlueberryTaskPane - get the user from GlobalVariables - LoggedInUser[1]
When publishing it asks to connect to Internet, even though the connection exists[1]
Try to input incorrect Blueberry ID[1]
Empty BlueberryID validation[1]
Write error hanlder for 500[1]
Pop up when uploading '{response:} - make it more user friendly[1]
When some of the items 'Publish' task pane are not filled up, its still possible to make a request[1]
Remove 'needs to contain a digit" in 'Publish taskpane'[1]
Sometimes when trying to log-in the system hangs with Stream postStream = request.GetRequestStream() - WebException problem[1]
Notification that the user should be logged in before sending publish/download/etc in Excel add-in[1]
Deploy to production[1]
Make the home page[http://blueberry-api.appspot.com/][1]
Think whether checking the user_agent[None in case of Excel is a good method to validate the source][3]
Clean up all scripts and unecessary stuff in HTML[2]
Replace all CDNs in HTML[2]
Create a common JS file[2]
Use jijnja2 inheritance to avoid multiple html editing for different html pages[2]
Implement handler for wrong username or password[1]
Implement users management in Excel Add-in[1]
Implement users management on GAE[1]
Document existing code[1]
Display dates correctly -2H
Currently the /Display only shows lists -> it should show all data types[1]
Change the name of the platform to RC Bay[1]
Implement a button to open the Blueberry Platform
Rethink the Publish concept - Update one data structure only/update all data structures in the workbook[1]
Think about xlID in 'Publishing' the same formatting as for xlName be aplied for xlOrganization?[1]
Think about all possible scenarios when think can go wrong and test them[1]
A very long string is entered in 'Description'
One of the items in 'Publish' task pane is not entered
When the list is imported it is pasted in a format [1,33,5,44,3]
When you click 'Publish' on BlueberryTaskPane, the same operations are performed twice[1]
Organize folders for the existing code
Set up documentation application SandCastle.
Finilize Dictionary data structure
Table data structure
Fix the git to make sure that all files are always pushed to bitbucket[3]
Fix add-in loading problem[2]
