# blueberry-api
blueberry-api is a prototype of Excel add-in which allows sharing and transforming tabular data between two Excel users via internet

This add-in is designed to ease and automate sharing of tabular data for financial reporting purposes. Usual practice is that a report created by one user requires financial data provided by another users. Currently this data is provided by sharing xlsx files via email. The purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate that data can be shared (and more importantly transformed and automated) from within Excel (without users having to exit the application and use externals tools like email). 

Technology stack:
- C# was used to design the Excel Add-In (native language for these types of witgets)
- Python was used for the backend
- Google App Engine was used as a cloud service
